# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Feature Name: Brand Central AI – Guided AI-Powered Brand Operating System

---

## Problem Statement

Modern brands and marketing teams struggle to translate abstract brand strategy into actionable, consistent, and scalable content and campaigns. Existing tools are fragmented, lack AI-powered guidance, and do not provide a unified workflow from brand positioning to content execution and analytics. There is a need for a single, guided platform that helps brands define, create, validate, and distribute content in alignment with their unique identity, leveraging the latest AI advancements.
